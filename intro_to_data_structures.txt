Question 1:
a.
	let array = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"];
b.
	function insertPerson(array, newPerson){
		array.push(newPerson);
		return array;
		}
	console.log(insertPerson(array, "Mary"));

c.d
	function findPerson(array, person){
		if(array.includes(person)){
			return array.indexOf(person);}
		else{
			return `${person} is not in this array`};
		}
	console.log(findPerson(array, "Josh"));
	console.log(findPerson(array, "Emily"));


e. 
	function addNewPerson (array, currentPerson, newPerson){
		let currentPersonIndex = array.indexOf(currentPerson);
		array.splice(currentPersonIndex, 0, newPerson);
		return array;
		}
	
	console.log(addNewPerson(array, 'Ava', 'Melissa'));

f. 
	function deletePerson(array, person){
		personIndex = array.indexOf(person);
		array.splice(personIndex, 1)
		return array;
		}
	
	console.log(deletePerson(array, 'Patrick'));

Question 2: Provide another real-world example that you can model using a data structure.
	We can delete the last person in the array by using pop() method, delete the first person by using shift() method.
	We can new person to the beginning of the array by using unshift() method.
	We can sort elements in the array alphabetically or in order by using sort() method. 
	

Question 3: How would your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
	Because array is a container, which stores elements inside its array with index(the location of element). So, programmers 
	can use index to manipulate and access the data. Besides, array has many methods, data structures make use of these methods to 
	implement the algorithms. 


Arrays are used to store data in a sequence, one element after another. By combining the location 
of the data and the ability to recover any element by using an index, the array simplifies access
 to and manipulation of ordered elements. Arrays are a good choice for collections of simple data 
 types such as strings, numbers, etc
